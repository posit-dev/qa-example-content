This cell should run.

```{r}
#| label: first cell
print("This is the first cell.")
```

This cell should not, unless it was run by itself, since it has eval: false.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: second cell

print("This is the second cell. It wasn't evaluated.")
```

This cell has an error. However, it has `error: false`, so execution should proceed after the error.

```{r}
#| error: false

stop("Oh no")
```

This cell should still run, since errors were ignored in the previous cell.

```{r}
print("It's the end of the world as we know it, but I feel fine.")
```

This cell has `error: true`, so if it throws an error, execution should halt.

```{r}
#| error: true

stop("Well, this is awkward.")
```

This cell shouldn't be executed, since it is after the cell that throws an error.


```{r}
print("How did we get here?")
```
