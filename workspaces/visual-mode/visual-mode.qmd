# Quarto Markdown Testing Document

This Quarto Markdown file is designed to test the following:
- Markdown syntax rendering
- Mode content synchronization
- Code block rendering
- YAML front matter rendering
- Equation rendering
- Code execution

---

## 1. Markdown Syntax Rendering

This is **bold** text and *italic* text.

Hereâ€™s an example of a [link](https://example.com).

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub-item 2.1
  - Sub-item 2.2

Inline code example: `summary(cars)`

---

## 2. Mode Content Synchronization

This section ensures that content is synchronized between source and visual modes.

**Instructions:**  
1. Switch to **source mode** and edit the text:  
   *"This is a test of synchronization."*  
2. Switch back to **visual mode** and verify the change persists.

Text to edit: **This is a test of synchronization.**

---

## 3. Code Block Rendering

### Python Code Block

```{python}
# A simple Python code block
print("Hello, Python!")
```

### R Code Block

```{r}
# A simple R code block
x <- 1:10
y <- x^2
plot(x, y)
```

---

## 4. YAML Front Matter Rendering

Ensure the YAML metadata at the top of this document renders correctly.

- **Title:** Should display as *Test Title*.
- **Author:** Should display as *Test Author*.
- **Date:** Should display as *2025-01-01*.

---

## 5. Equation Rendering

### Inline Equation
The famous equation is $E = mc^2$.

### Block Equation
$$
\int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

---

## 6. Code Execution

Run the following R code and ensure it executes correctly:

```{r}
# Generate a summary of the cars dataset
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
# Generate a basic plot
x <- seq(1, 100, by = 1)
y <- x^2 + rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 500)
plot(x, y, main = "Example Plot", col = "blue", pch = 19)
```

---

## 7. Table Rendering

Ensure tables are preserved in both **source mode** and **visual mode**.

| Name  | Age | City       |
|-------|-----|------------|
| Alice | 30  | New York   |
| Bob   | 25  | San Diego  |

---

### **Summary**
This `.qmd` file tests markdown rendering, YAML metadata, equations, synchronization between modes, code block rendering, code execution, and table formatting.
